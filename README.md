This project was created spontaneously. One day, when I was srolling 'Behance' I found an interesting web layout for Max Mara Atelier , designed by talented graphic designer. I was impressed ! I decideed to code it imidiatelly ! I used Less pre-processor and BEM methodology for CSS. Becouse of this, my code is more efficient and clear right now. Let's check results on my github !   Date of create : April 2018  Used technologies: HTML | CSS / Less | Bootstrap | Bower | Grunt
